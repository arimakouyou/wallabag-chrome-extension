# Development Principles
- Always respond in Japanese
- **Use the Latest Libraries**: Leverage context7 to ensure you are using the most up-to-date versions of libraries.

- **Proactive Research**: When you encounter something you don't understand, actively search for information and solutions.

- **Rely on Official Sources**: Before using an external library, always refer to the official documentation and its source code, rather than relying solely on prior knowledge.

- **Incremental and Verified Progress**: Break down tasks into small, manageable steps. Ensure that the build succeeds and all tests pass before moving on to the next task.

- **Task File Management**: Before starting a task, update the corresponding task file in `CLAUDE/TASK`. Remember to update it again upon completion.
